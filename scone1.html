<h1>Fruit Scones</h1>

<div style="position:relative; top:75px" class="prep">Preparation: 5 mins    &nbsp; 	Difficulty: Easy	<br>
	Serves: 8 people	&nbsp;	Cook Time: 10 mins</div>


<h2>Ingredients&emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp;Method</h2>
<div style ="position:relative; top:-100px" class="ingredients">
<p>350g self-raising flour, plus more for dusting <br>
	<br>
	1 tsp baking powder <br>
	<br>
	85g butter, cut into cubes <br>
	<br>
	3 tbsp caster sugar <br>
	<br>
	175ml milk <br>
	<br>
	1 tsp vanilla extract <br>
	<br>
	squeeze lemon juice (see tips below) <br>
	<br>
	beaten egg, to glaze <br>
	<br>
	jam and clotted cream, to serve</p></div>
<div style ="position:relative; top:-700px" class="method">
<p>STEP 1 <br>
	Heat the oven to 220C/200C fan/gas 7. Tip the self-raising flour into a large bowl with ¼ tsp salt and the baking powder, then mix.<br>
	<br>
	STEP 2<br>
	Add the butter, then rub in with your fingers until the mix looks like fine crumbs. Stir in the caster sugar.<br>
	<br>
	STEP 3 <br>
	Put the milk into a jug and heat in the microwave for about 30 secs until warm, but not hot.<br>Add the vanilla extract and a squeeze of lemon juice, then set aside for a moment.<br>
	<br>
	STEP 4 <br>
	Put a baking tray in the oven. Make a well in the dry mix, then add the liquid and combine it quickly with a cutlery knife <br>– it will seem pretty wet at first.<br>
	<br>
	STEP 5 <br>
	Scatter some flour onto the work surface and tip the dough out. Dredge the dough and your hands with a little more flour,<br> then fold the dough over 2-3 times until it’s a little smoother. <br>Pat into a round about 4cm deep. Take a 5cm cutter (smooth-edged cutters tend to cut more cleanly, giving a better rise)<br> and dip it into some flour. <br>Plunge into the dough, then repeat until you have four scones. <br>You may need to press what’s left of the dough back into a round to cut out another four.<br>
	<br>
	STEP 6 <br>
	Brush the tops with a beaten egg, then carefully arrange on the hot baking tray. Bake for 10 mins until risen and golden on the top.<br> Eat just warm or cold on the day of baking, generously topped with jam and clotted cream. <br>If freezing, freeze once cool. Defrost, then put in a low oven (about 160C/140C fan/gas 3) for a few minutes to refresh.</p>
