<h2>Ingredients&emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp;Method</h2>
<div style ="position:relative; top:10px" class="ingredients">
<p>1kg Bramley apples<br>
    <br>
    140g golden caster sugar<br>
    <br>
    ½ tsp cinnamon<br>
    <br>
    3 tbsp flour<br>
    <br>
    For the pastry<br>
    <br>
    225g butter, room temperature<br>
    <br>
    50g golden caster sugar, plus extra<br>
    <br>
    2 eggs<br>
    <br>
    350g plain flour, preferably organic<br>
    <br>
    softly whipped cream, to serve
    </p></div>

<div style ="position:relative; top:-700px" class="method">
<p>STEP 1<br>
    Put a layer of paper towels on a large baking sheet. Quarter, core, peel and slice the apples about 5mm thick <br>and lay evenly on the baking sheet. Put paper towels on top and set aside while you make and chill the pastry. <br>
    <br>
    STEP 2<br>
    For the pastry, beat the butter and sugar in a large bowl until just mixed. <br>Break in a whole egg and a yolk (keep the white for glazing later). Beat together for just under 1 min – it will<br> look a bit like scrambled egg. Now work in the flour with a wooden spoon, a third at a time, until it’s beginning to clump up,<br> then finish gathering it together with your hands. Gently work the dough into a ball, wrap in cling film, and chill for 45 mins.<br> Now mix the 140g/5oz sugar, the cinnamon and flour for the filling in a bowl that is large enough to take the apples later.<br>
    <br>
    STEP 3<br>
    After the pastry has chilled, heat the oven to 190C/fan 170C/gas 5. Lightly beat the egg white with a fork. <br>Cut off a third of the pastry and keep it wrapped while you roll out the rest, and use this to line a pie tin – 20-22cm round and <br>4cm deep – leaving a slight overhang. Roll the remaining third to a circle about 28cm in diameter. <br>Pat the apples dry with kitchen paper, and tip them into the bowl with the cinnamon-sugar mix. <br>Give a quick mix with your hands and immediately pile high into the pastry-lined tin.<br>
    <br>
    STEP 4<br>
    Brush a little water around the pastry rim and lay the pastry lid over the apples pressing the edges together to seal.<br> Trim the edge with a sharp knife and make 5 little slashes on top of the lid for the steam to escape. <br>(Can be frozen at this stage.) Brush it all with the egg white and sprinkle with caster sugar. Bake for 40-45 mins, until golden,<br> then remove and let it sit for 5-10 mins. Sprinkle with more sugar and serve while still warm from the oven with softly whipped cream.<br>
