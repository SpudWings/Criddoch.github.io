<h1>Homemade Vegan Bagel</h1>
<div style="position:relative; top:75px" class="prep">Preparation: 30 mins    &nbsp; 	Difficulty: Hard	<br>
	Serves: 10 Bagels	&nbsp;	Cook Time: 30 Minutes (Plus 1 Hour rising)</div>


<h2>Ingredients&emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp;Method</h2>
<div style ="position:relative; top:10px" class="ingredients">
<p>7g sachet dried yeast<br>
    <br>
    4 tbsp sugar<br>
    <br>
    2 tsp salt<br>
    <br>
    450g bread flour<br>
    <br>
    poppy, fennel and/or sesame seeds to <br>sprinkle on top (optional)
    </p></div>

<div style ="position:relative; top:-700px" class="method">
<p>STEP 1<br>
    Tip the yeast and 1 tbsp sugar into a large bowl, and pour over 100ml warm water. Leave for 10 mins until the mixture becomes frothy. <br>
    <br>
    STEP 2<br>
    Pour 200ml warm water into the bowl, then stir in the salt and half the flour. Keep adding the remaining flour <br>(you may not have to use it all) and mixing with your hands until you have a soft but not sticky dough. <br>Then knead for 10 mins until the dough feels smooth and elastic. Shape into a ball and put in a clean, lightly oiled bowl.<br> Cover loosely and leave in a warm place until doubled in size, about 1hr.<br>
    <br>
    STEP 3<br>
    Heat the oven to 220C/200C fan/gas 7. On a lightly floured surface, divide the dough into 10 pieces, each about 85g.<br> Shape each piece into a flattish ball, then take a wooden spoon and use the handle to make a hole in the middle of each ball.<br> Slip the spoon into the hole, then twirl the bagel around the spoon to make a hole about 3cm wide.<br> Cover the bagel loosely while you shape the remaining dough.<br>
    <br>
    STEP 4<br>
    Meanwhile, bring a large pan of water to the boil and tip in the remaining sugar. Slip the bagels into the boiling water –<br> no more than four at a time. Cook for 1-2 mins, turning over in the water until the bagels have puffed slightly and a skin has formed.<br> Remove with a slotted spoon and drain away any excess water. Sprinkle over your choice of topping and place on a baking tray <br>lined with parchment. Bake in the oven for 25 mins until browned and crisp – the bases should sound hollow when tapped. <br>Leave to cool on a wire rack, then serve with your favourite filling.
